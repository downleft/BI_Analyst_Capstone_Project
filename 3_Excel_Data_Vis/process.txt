1_Data_Vis

This part of the project involves consolidating multiple spreadsheets and creating visualizations.

Below are the steps taken in the Data Visualization phase of this project using the Excel Worksheet entitled BI_Analyst_Capstone_M03L01.xlsx.

1. Consolidate the six provided Excel sheets into one file.
2. Use VLOOKUP to combine data from various sheets into the all_sheets_combined sheet.
3. Create a pivot chart for Sales by Store
    a. Use this pivot chart to create a bar chart showing total sales per store
    b. Use this pivot chart to create a line chart showing sales trends over time for each store.
4. Create a pivot chart for Sales based on City, Store, and Product_hierarchy
    a. Copy values from above pivot chart to another sheet 
    b. Use this data to create a sunburst chart
5. Create a sheet containing only stock and sales data.  This sheet contains 300000 rows of data.
    a. Excel for the web will not create a scatter plot when given more than 10000 data points.
    b. To compensate, duplicate values were dropped from this sheet, dropping data size down to 1064 data points.
    c. Create a scatter plot for this data set and plot the trendline

2_Statistical_Analysis
Below are the steps taken in the Statistical Analysis phase of this project using the Excel Worksheet entitled BI_Analyst_Capstone_M03L02.xlsx.

Note: Instructions were given to use of 20000 rows from the data set; the first 20000 rows were selected.

The XLMiner Analysis ToolPak is used to determine regression analysis for the data.

The R-squared value of 0.00000649 shows that 0.000649% of variance is explained by the model.
The Significance F of 0.7186 is the p-value of the model. Since it is greater than 0.05, the model is not significant.
A coefficient of 0.000555 indicates that for every day that passes, sales should increase by 0.000555 units.

Regression Equation: y=0.000554764343405622x-23.1884010620415

Based on the regression equation, we would expect it to take 5 years for daily sales cause be date to increase by 1 unit.
