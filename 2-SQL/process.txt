1_Data Querying

This part of the project sets up a database using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin.

1. Using the PostgreSQL CLI, a dump file with predefined tables and structures was downloaded with wget.
    wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/vvSv1oI9D625FbbghI9KUQ/BI-dump.sql

2. Using the PostgreSQL CLI, create and populate a database entitled BICapstone
    CREATE DATABASE BICapstone;
    \connect bicapstone;
    \include BI-dump.sql

3. Through pgAdmin, verify table creation and population occurred using SQL code below.
    SELECT * FROM city_names LIMIT 5;
    SELECT * FROM product_hierarchy LIMIT 5;
    SELECT * FROM product_names LIMIT 5;
    SELECT * FROM sales LIMIT 5;
    SELECT * FROM store_cities LIMIT 5;
    SELECT * FROM store_names LIMIT 5;

4. Analyze sales performance by store and city
    SELECT p.product_id,
    c.store_id,
    c.city_id,
    SUM (sl.sales) AS total_sales,
    SUM (sl.revenue) AS total_revenue,
    AVG (sl.price) AS average_price
    FROM sales sl
    INNER JOIN product_hierarchy p ON sl.product_id = p.product_id
    INNER JOIN store_cities c ON sl.store_id = c.store_id
    GROUP BY p.product_id, c.store_id, c.city_id;

2_Data_Analysis

1. Store and month rollup using SQL code below
    SELECT store_id,
    TO_CHAR (date, 'YYYY-MM') AS month_of_sale,
    SUM (sales) AS total_sales
    FROM SALES sl
    INNER JOIN product_hierarchy p ON sl.product_id = p.product_id
    GROUP BY ROLLUP (store_id, month_of_sale);

2. Hierarchy based sales Analysis
    SELECT p.hierarchy1_id, p.hierarchy2_id,
    SUM (sales) AS total_sales
    FROM SALES sl
    INNER JOIN product_hierarchy p ON sl.product_id = p.product_id
    GROUP BY ROLLUP (p.hierarchy1_id, p.hierarchy2_id);
    
3. City and month cube
    SELECT c.city_id,
    TO_CHAR (date, 'YYYY-MM') AS month_of_sale,
    SUM (sales) AS total_sales
    FROM SALES sl
    INNER JOIN store_cities c ON sl.store_id = c.store_id
    GROUP BY CUBE (c.city_id, month_of_sale);
