Data Cleaning Processes

For this part of the project, a dataset that originated from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkayalan/retail-sales-data/data).
This dataset was modified so as to not exceed Microsoft Excel data limits.

Below are the steps taken to clean the data for the BI Analyst Capstone Project.

1. Create an Excel Worksheet entitled BI_Analyst_Capstone_M01L01.xlsx using the web version of Microsoft Excel
2. Import CSV files from the Resources file to BI_Analyst_Capstone_ML.xlsx
3. Filter out 710 rows with blank values for price on the 'sales' sheet
4. Adjust number formatting for consistency

Pivot Table Processes
For this part of the project, another modified dataset for creating Pivot Tables.

Below are the steps taken in the pivot table phase of this project using the Excel Worksheet entitled BI_Analyst_Capstone_M01L02.xlsx.

1. Identify primary keys, foreign keys, and interrelations
    a. Sales table
        i. product_id refers to product_hierarchy product_id
        ii. store_id refers to store_names store_id
    b. Product_hierarchy table has primary key of product_id
    c. Store_cities table 
        i. store_id is the primary key that refers to store_names store_id
        ii. city id refers to city_names
    d. Store_names table  has primary key of store_id
    e. City_names table has primary key of city_id
    f. Product_names table has primary key of product_id that refers to product_hierarchy product_id
2. Use VLOOKUP to combine data from various tables into the sales_trimeed_cleaned table
3. Create pivot tables for following scenarios:
    a. Sales+Store_pivot
        i. For each store, find total sales, total stock, total revenue, and average sales.
        ii. Filterable based on store name and date.
    b. Sales+City_Pivot
        i. For each city, find total sales, total revenue, and average sales.
        ii. Filterable based on store name and date.
    c. Sales+Product_Pivot
        i. For each product, find total sales, total revenue, and average sales.
        ii. Filterable based on product name and date.
